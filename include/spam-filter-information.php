<h2>SPAM FILTERS:</h2>
<p>
If you are using spam filters which require confirmation
of incoming email, these reports will be coming from the following domains:
</p>

<table class="spam-info bordered">
<tr><td>Domain</td><td>Reason</td></tr>
<tr><td><code class="code">freshports.org</code></td><td>All reports originate from that domain.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code class="code">unixathome.org</code></td><td>The websites are hosted on a box in that domain.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code class="code">langille.org</code></td><td>If I need to write to you, it will come from that domain.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Ensure that you update your spam filters to allow such incoming messages.  
If your spam tools require that a confirmation be sent, you'll have
to modify things as no confirmations will be sent for FreshPorts messages.
</p>
