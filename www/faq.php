	This website will help you keep up with the latest releases of your
	favorite software.  When a new version of the software is available,
	FreshPorts will send you an email telling you about the change.

	Your primary FreshPorts tool is your <b>watch list</b>.  This is the
	collection of ports which you have selected for FreshPorts to
	keep track of.  You will be emailed when a change is found
	for one of your watched ports.

	<p>
	You can have more than one watch list.  Most people would have
	one watch list for each machine they administer.  I suggest giving
	the watch list the same name as the machine.  Email notifications
	will contain headers with the list name.  You can use that for any
	filtering you may want to do (e.g. procmail).

	<p>
	You should be familiar with the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html">Ports</a>
	section of <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html">The FreeBSD Handbook</a>.
	Pay careful attention to the difference between a port and a package.

	<h2>Definitions for the hopelessly lazy</h2>

	<h3 id="port">What is a port?</h3>
	<p>
	If you install the port, the source will be downloaded, patched if necessary,
	compiled and installed.  You will have a chance to set any optional configuration
	items particular to that port. If the port is dependent upon another port,
	that port will also be installed.  After installing, ports are identical to
	packages.

	<p>
	It is because of these compile time options that I prefer ports over packages.

	<h3 id="package">What is a package?</h3>
	<p>
	A package is a compiled port.  It is a binary.  When you install the package, 
	you will download a binary and it will be installed.

	<p>
	Packages often lag behind ports.  That is usually because it takes time to compile
	the packages, etc.  If you want the latest version, and the package is not
	available, then you should install the port.

	<p>
	Not all ports can have packages, often because of license restrictions that
	prevent binary distribution.

	There are three easy ways to modify your watch list:

	<LI>The 'watch list categories' link provides you with a list

	<LI>Use the 'upload' link to upload your pkg_info data into your
		watch list staging area and then into your watch list.</LI>

	A port is a simple easy way to install an application.
	A port is a collection of files.  These files contain the location
	of the source file, any patches which must be applied,
	instructions for building the application, and the installation
	procedure.  Removing an installed port is also easy.  For full

	repository, a mail message is sent out to the cvs-all mailing list.  FreshPorts
	takes these mail messages, parses them, and then loads them into a database.
	In theory, it's fairly straight forward.  In practice, there's much more to

	There are a few symbols you will see in this website.

	<P id="fallout"><?php echo freshports_Fallout_Icon(); ?>
		Fallout: a link to search the pkg-fallout archives for this port.</P>

	<P id="bugs-find"><?php echo freshports_Bugs_Find_Icon(); ?>
		Find Bugs: a link to search for open Problem Reports (issues/bugs) for this port.</P>

	<P id="bugs-add"><?php echo freshports_Bugs_Report_Icon(); ?>
		New Bug: a link to open a new Problem Reports (issue/bug) for this port.</P>

	<P id="new"><?php echo freshports_New_Icon(); ?>
		New: This port has been recently added. A port is marked as new for 10 days.</P>

	<P id="forbidden"><?php echo freshports_Forbidden_Icon(); ?>
		Forbidden: The port is marked as forbidden. If you view the port details,
		you will see why. Most often, it is because of a security exploit. Packages for a forbidden port are not built
        by the package cluster. Therefore, <code>pkg install</code> will not work.</P>

	<P id="broken"><?php echo freshports_Broken_Icon(); ?>
		Broken: The port is marked as broken. Perhaps it won't compile. Maybe
		it doesn't work under FreeBSD right now. If you view the port details,
		you will see the reason why. Packages for a broken port are not built
        by the package cluster. Therefore, <code>pkg install</code> will not work.</P>

	<P id="deprecated"><?php echo freshports_Deprecated_Icon(); ?>
		Deprecated: The port is marked as deprecated. Perhaps it has exceeded
		its lifetime or is obselete.</P>

	<P id="expiration"><?php echo freshports_Expiration_Icon(); ?>
		Expiration Date: The port has an expiration date. A port may be removed from the
        tree after this date. Often added in conjunction with Deprecated.</P>

	<P id="expired"><?php echo freshports_Expired_Icon(); ?>
		Expired: The port has passed the expiration date. A port may be removed from the
        tree after this date. Often added in conjunction with Deprecated.</P>

	<P id="ignore"><?php echo freshports_Ignore_Icon(); ?>
		Ignore: The port is marked as ignore. It probably does not build. Packages for an ignored port are not built
        by the package cluster. Therefore, <code>pkg install</code> will not work.</P>

	<P id="files"><?php echo freshports_Files_Icon(); ?>
		Files: If you click on this graphic, you will be taken to the list of files
		touched by the commit in question.</P>

	<P id="refresh"><?php echo freshports_Refresh_Icon(); ?>
		Refresh: The system is in the process of refreshing that port by inspecting
		the ports tree. You should rarely see this.</P>
		<p>If you do see one, chances are that the port contains an error
		that prevents make(1) from running. For example:

<blockquote><code class="code">
$ make -V PORTVERSION<br>
"Makefile", line 271: 1 open conditional<br>
make: fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue
</code></blockquote>

		<p>
		In such circumstances, the port committer is notified (if they have
		opted in to the FreshPorts Sanity Check Report) and they should
		fix the problem as soon as possible. Once you see a more recent
		commit without a refresh icon,
		then the problem has been fixed. The refresh icons will go away after
		FreshPorts has dealt with the old commits. This may take a few hours.</p>

	<P id="deleted"><?php echo freshports_Deleted_Icon(); ?>
		Deleted: This port has been removed from the ports tree.</P>

	<P id="mail"><?php echo freshports_Mail_Icon(); ?>
		Commit message: This link will take you to the original cvs-all message in the FreeBSD mailing list archives.
		Note that it can take a few minutes for the message to appear in the archives. This link will not appear
		for commit messages before 3 March 2002 (which is the date FreshPorts started to store the message-id).</P>

	<P id="commit"><?php echo freshports_Commit_Icon(); ?>
		FreshPorts commit message: This will take you to the FreshPorts commit
		message and allow you to see all other ports which were affected by this commit. This link will not appear
        for commit messages before 3 March 2002 (which is the date FreshPorts started to store the message-id).

        NOTE: This link has been made redundant by recent advances in the Files link. See next icon.
        </P>

	<P id="watch"><?php echo freshports_Watch_Icon(); ?>
		Item is on one of your default watch lists: This port is on one of your default watch lists. Click
		this icon to remove the port from your default watch lists. This icon appears only if you are logged in.</P>

	<P id="watch-add"><?php echo freshports_Watch_Icon_Add(); ?>
		Add item to your default watch lists: This port is not on any of your default watch lists. Click
		this icon to add the port to your default watch lists. This icon appears only if you are logged in.</P>

	<P id="encodingerrors"><?php echo freshports_Encoding_Errors(); ?>
		Encoding Errors (not all of the commit message was ASCII): Some of the
		commit message may be altered because of character conversion problems. We display only UTF-8 and remove
		the offending characters. These errors may occur in the log message or elsewhere in the commit email.</P>

	<P id="watchlistcount"><?php echo freshports_WatchListCount_Icon(); ?>
		Watch List Count (WLC): This is the number of watch lists which are watching
		this port. This might give you an idea of the popularity of the port.</P>

	<P id="git"><?php echo freshports_Git_Icon(); ?>
		Git Repository: This link will take you to the Git Repository entry

		CVS Repository: This link will take you to the CVS Repository entry
		for this version of the file.</P>

	<P id="vuxml"><?php echo freshports_VuXML_Icon(); ?>
		<a href="https://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/">VuXML</a> vulnerability. Click icon for details.</P>

	<P id="vuxml-past"><?php echo freshports_VuXML_Icon_Faded(); ?>
		A past <a href="https://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/">VuXML</a> vulnerability. Click icon for details.</P>

	<P id="restricted"><?php echo freshports_Restricted_Icon(); ?>
		This port has some restrictions on it.</P>

	<P id="no_cdrom"><?php echo freshports_No_CDROM_Icon(); ?>
		This port has some restrictions with respect to being included on a CD-ROM.</P>

	<P id="is_interactive"><?php echo freshports_Is_Interactive_Icon(); ?>
		This port will require interaction during installation.</P>

	<P id="depends"><?php echo freshports_Search_Icon(); ?>
		Dependency Search: Action depends on context. Click on this icon to search for ports depending on the
		current port, ports maintained by the current maintainer, or other commits by the current comitter.</P>

	<P id="revision"><?php echo freshports_Revision_Icon(); ?>
		Revision details. Click on the Files icon in the commit history and
		you'll see what files in this port were touched by this commit. Click on the Revision details to view the
		revision of the file associated this commit.</P>

	<P id="annotate"><?php echo freshports_Annotate_Icon(); ?>
		Annotate: If you click on this graphic, you will be taken to a view of the file in question, with a

   <P>
	Some ports (for example <a href="/net/">net</a>/<a href="/net/gift/">gift</a>) will have a section titled "Port Moves".
	FreshPorts obtains information about ports from the commits to the 
	<a href="<?php echo FRESHPORTS_FREEBSD_CVS_URL; ?>">CVS Repository</a>.  However, not all
	changes to ports occur because of commits.  A manual change to the repository,
	often referred to as a repo-copy, can move a port from one category to another.
	Such a change is done to ensure the port history is retained.

	<p>
	Repo-copies are documented in <a href="/MOVED">/usr/ports/MOVED</a>.  FreshPorts parses this file and records
	these changes in its database.

	<p>
	This new feature was added on 31 December 2003.

<code class="code">/usr/ports/UPDATING</code> is similar to

FreshPorts parses this file and attempts to relate the entries to any ports
it can find.  Such relations are not always possible.  We do the best we can.
The <a href="/net/openldap22-client/">net/openldap22-client</a> port is a good

	Some ports are so similar to another port that it makes sense to maintain just one port

	<code class="code">/etc/rc.conf</code>.

	<p>
	A good example is <a href="/www/">www</a>/<a href="/www/mod_php4">mod_php4</a>. You 
	can see that the <b>master port</b> for that is <a href="/lang/">lang</a>/<a href="/lang/php4/">php4</a>.

	<p>
	The FreeBSD tree has no defined method for handling master/slave ports.
	It is because of this that FreshPorts never attempted to refresh slave ports
	when a master port was updated.  Now that we have a mostly-reliable method,
	all slave ports are refreshed when the master port is updated.

	<p>
	This method works for all but 40 ports which are involved in a master/slave relationship.
	It is hoped that those 40 are fixed soon.  It is also hoped that the above patch
	is comitted to the tree.

</TR>

	<TR><TD class="textcontent">
	<P>
	Included within the port description is the instruction for adding the package.
	This information can be important when the package name does not match the
	port name.  A good example is <a href="/x11/">x11</a>/<a href="/x11/XFree86-4-clients/">XFree86-4-clients</a>.
	The command to add this package is:

<blockquote><code class="code">
pkg install XFree86-clients
</code></blockquote>

	<p>
	This normally isn't a problem, but for the 1900 or so ports which are different,
	this information is very useful.

	<p>
	If the <code class="code">pkg install</code> information does not appear,
	you'll be told why there is no package.  This is controlled by the
	<code class="code">NO_PACKAGE</code> variable in the port's Makefile.

	<p>
	Broken, ignored, and forbidden ports are not built by the package
	cluster.  Therefore, there is no package for <code>pkg install</code> to use.

<TR id="fp-search-get">
<?php echo freshports_PageBannerText('Why does the search page use GET and not POST?'); ?>
</TR>

   <TR><TD class="textcontent">
   <P>
If you visit the <a href="/search.php">search</a> page, and you run a search,
you'll find that the URL becomes very long.  For example, 
<a href="/search.php?query=bacula&amp;search=go&amp;num=10&amp;stype=name&amp;method=match&amp;deleted=excludedeleted&amp;start=1&amp;casesensitivity=caseinsensitive">this really long link</a>.
<p>
Long URLs occur like that because the search form uses a GET.  A long URL
would not occur if it was using a POST.  The long URLs are useful because
they allow you to bookmark your favorite search.  That is why a GET is used
instead of a POST.

<p>
It also makes it easier to <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">validate the HTML</a>
if you can provide a URL that exercises all the options that require testing.

	For example:

<blockquote><code class="code">
$ cd /usr/ports/sysutils/bacula/<br>
$ make -V PORTNAME<br>

<?php echo freshports_PageBannerText('Where did this "People watching this port, also watch" feature come from?'); ?>
</TR>

   <TR><TD class="textcontent">
   <P>
Like many FreshPorts features, this idea came from someone else.  Florent 
Thoumie mentioned something about extending the ports system to include 
recommendations from maintainers/committers.  Such a feature would allow
a committer/maintainer to suggest, for example, that if you install Firefox,
that you also install linuxflashplugin.

<p>
It was from this concept that I came up with "People watching this port...".
This information is obtained by:
<ol>
<li>FreshPorts takes the port you are looking at
<li>It finds all the watch lists that this port appears on
<li>It finds the top 5 most popular ports on those lists
<li>FreshPorts shows you the results
</ol>

<p>
All of this takes about 55ms.

<TR id="master-updated">
<?php echo freshports_PageBannerText('What do you mean, the master port has been updated?'); ?>
</TR>

   <TR><TD class="textcontent">
   <P>
For some slave ports, you may see a message like this, just above the <b>Commit History</b>:

<blockquote>
NOTE: This slave port may no longer be vulnerable to issues shown below because the master port has been updated.
</blockquote>

<p>
Slave ports can be updated with a commit against the master port.  A commit
against the master port will affect any slave ports.  If a
<a href="https://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/">VuXML</a> vulnerability has been recorded
against a slave port, any fix would be applied to the master port.
However, the commit to the master port would not appear under the slave port,
thereby giving a false impression
that the slave port was still vulnerable.

<p>
The above notice serves as a reminder that the slave port may no longer be vulnerable.

<TR id="determine-master">
<?php echo freshports_PageBannerText('How does FreshPorts determine the master sites?'); ?>
</TR>

   <TR><TD class="textcontent">
   <P>
Each port displays the master sites from which its distfiles can be downloaded.  This
information is obtained from "make master-sites-all".  However, this is not the only
list of master sites that a port knows about.  Edwin Groothuis explains it in this
<a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/mid.cgi?20041219204057.GE63708">email</a>.

<p>
In short, FreshPorts displays the list of master sites that should contain all
the distfiles.  That is why we use that value, and not one of the other options.

<TR id="mailto-clear">
<?php echo freshports_PageBannerText('Why don\'t you obscure email addresses?'); ?>
</TR>

   <TR><TD class="textcontent">
   <P>
FreshPorts used to obscure email addresses, but we don't any more.  We realised that
every email address on FreshPorts is already somewhere else first. For example:

<ul>
<li>www/ports pages
<li>portsmon
<li>fenner's output
<li>GNATS
<li>cvsweb
</ul>

<p>
In short, it doesn't make sense to obscure that which is freely available elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, we do not entertain requests to remove information from our website. We only report upon what exists elsewhere.

<TR id="portversion-differ">
<?php echo freshports_PageBannerText('Why does the PORTVERSION at the top of page differ from that of the first commit?'); ?>
</TR>

   <TR><TD class="textcontent">
   <P>
   This question refers to a port page.
   
<p>
This situation usually occurs with MASTER/SLAVE ports.  The Master port is updated with a new
REVISION.  No commit is done against the Slave port.  FreshPorts knows to refresh the Slave port
when its Master port is updated.    This refresh updates the PORTVERSION at the top of the 
page.  This update reflects the REVISION you would get if you were to install the Slave port
now that the Master has been upgraded.

<TR id="anchors">
<?php echo freshports_PageBannerText('What HTML anchors exist?'); ?>
</TR>

   <TR><TD class="textcontent">
   <p>Anchors in port pages include: </p>

<p>
	Anchors make it easier to link to sections within pages.

<p>
	For example, this link – note the <code class="code">#history</code> at its tail – takes you to the commit history for security/acme.sh: 
</p>

<blockquote><a href="/security/acme.sh/#history">security/acme.sh/#history</a></blockquote>

<p>
	Browser extensions such as <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/display-anchors#readme">Display #Anchors</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/anchors-reveal/">Anchors Reveal</a> can help to visualise anchors that would otherwise be invisible. 
</p>
<p>
	Enjoy. We can add more anchors upon request.
